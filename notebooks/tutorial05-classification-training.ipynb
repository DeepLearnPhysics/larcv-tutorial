    "In this notebook we train a simple, 10-layers deep convolutional neural network for classifying 5 particle images in a simulated LArTPC detecotr available from the [public dataset](http://deeplearnphysics.org/DataChallenge). We use tensorflow to train the network and `larcv_threadio` to fetch data from larcv files. If you are completely unfamiliar with `larcv_threadio`, go look at this [quick start](http://deeplearnphysics.org/Blog/tutorial04.html). First let's prepare data samples. For the setup of this example, I need to prepare `practice_train_10k.root` and `practice_test_10k.root` in the current directory. Let us make symbolic links."

    "This notebook covered training convolutional neural networks to perform image classification of 5 LArTPC particles using a practice files. We encourage you to design your own network and train on our [public dataset](http://deeplearnphysics.org/DataChallenge)! We provide 50,000 entries of 5 particle images (10,000 per particle) for training and separate 40,000 for testing your network. When you are confident, try our *data challenge*, yet another set of 40,000 events without _answers_ (i.e. no `particle` information). Share your awesome result in the CSV format to [us](contact@deeplearnphysics.org) with your network architecture made available on a github repository. "
